Employee Management System (Java)

A simple **Employee Management System** built using **Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. This project allows users to **add, remove, search, and display employees** through a console-based interface. The entire application is implemented **in a single Java file** while still demonstrating **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.
